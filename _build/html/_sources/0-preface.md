## Learning Environments for This Course

This course is fully online and is supported by various digital learning environments. 

Here is a high-level overview of how things would work:

1. Course content site: The site you are reading now hosts weekly content created by the instructor, including text, instructional videos, tutorials, Jupyter notebooks, etc. This site is open to public, and is the only part of the course open to public. 
2. Course Canvas site: Students formally registered for the course at Penn will have access to a Canvas site through which they submit course assignments. The Canvas site is only open to Penn students. 
3. Hypothesis: Hypothesis is a social annotation tool that enables us to discuss readings in a contextual manner. Penn students will receive a link that invites you to join a private Hypothesis group. When annotating, please make sure our group name is properly selected.  When setting up your Hypothesis account, please try to use your Pennkey (or something recognizable) as the username so that the instructor and your peers can recognize you when discussing course readings.
4. Zoom: The class meets on Mondays through Zoom. Penn students will receive a Zoom link that we use throughout the semester. 
5. Other social media sites: Hey, this course is about networks and learning. I bet our learning is happening in other types of networked environments. So don't limit ourselves to the spaces I am setting up for the course. Help us get connected to other sites where you learn about this cool topic. 


### What to expect each week?

This online class is designed to offer rich opportunities for social participation. Below is how a week would (typically) look like. 

- **Our class meetings happen on Mondays.** The class meetings are designed for us to chat about things we've learned, deepen our understanding, review code, discuss future plans, etc. Depending on each week's topic, we will meet 60-90 minutes on Zoom. 
- **A fresh week starts on Tuesday.** Depending on your schedule, you can get started with course readings and begin to make annotations.
- **By the end of Friday**, you are expected to finish reading articles assigned for the week and post your personal annotations on Hypothesis.
- **By the end of Monday**, you are expected to check out what other colleagues annotated and reply to each other. You will receive an email notification when someone responds to you. It is hoped that by putting our minds together we can develop deeper understanding. 
- On Monday, we meet again on Zoom. 


Looking to a great journey with everyone!
