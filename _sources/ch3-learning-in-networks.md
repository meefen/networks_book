# Learning in networks

## Basic ideas about networks

Extending our discussions in the past week, I created a video to elaborate on a number of basic ideas about networks and social networks.

## Learning in networks

This week, we are focused on thinking about learning in or through networks. 

The use of network analysis to examine learning needs to be informed by theories of learning and contexts in which learning happens.

During this week, you are engaged to explore several different theories that emphasize a "network worldview" and are widely applied to guide network analysis.
